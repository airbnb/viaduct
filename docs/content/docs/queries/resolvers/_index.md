In Viaduct, *all* tenant code is provided in the form of either a *node resolver* or a *field resolver*.  You implement either kind of resolver by providing a subclass of a *resolver base class* that we generate for you.  Resolver base classes are best understood through the examples in this section.

## Injection

When you annotate any property or entity within a graphql schema with @Resolver, Viaduct will generate code to act as an abstract class for that resolver.  Itâ€™s then up to you to implement that class, and provide instances of it to be used by Viaduct when the resolver is called by a graphql engine..  Viaduct is designed to find such instances through dependency injection. This is defined by using this interface:

```kotlin
interface TenantCodeInjector {
    fun <T> getProvider(clazz: Class<T>): Provider<T>
}
```

By default (primarily for tests) Viaduct will assume that a zero-argument constructor will be available for any resolver you may need to write, and Viaduct will automatically construct a single instance of this class to be used whenever the resolver is called.  Note that this is not guaranteed to be thread-safe, so it is not recommended as your main approach.

Examples of using this dependency injection mechanism are available in the demo applications.
